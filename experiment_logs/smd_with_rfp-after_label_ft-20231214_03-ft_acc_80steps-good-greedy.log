First, I'll remove the table header from the markdown table, since you don't want to include it in the JSON format answer:

%%%% [/INST]  Of course! I'd be happy to help you merge the markdown table rows in `JSON` format.

First, let me clarify that you want me to merge each content row in the table, which means replace `|` with a space in the row. For example:
The first row in the table is:
| M1   | The RPA solution must provide a bilingual (Official  languages– English and French) interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                             |

Then, the merged row in `JSON` format would be:
```json
{
 "request": "Merge each content row in the table",
 "rows": [
   "M1 The RPA solution must provide a bilingual (Official languages– English and French) interface.",
   "M2.1 The Contractor must provide a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) solution that will operate on an enterprise-class infrastructure using physical and virtual machines (VMs).",
   "M2.2 The RPA solution must include a design suite that will allow ESDC to develop and deliver automated processes.",
   "M3 The Contractor must provide a complete list of all components and version numbers included in their solution and must include: a) an Enterprise Optical character recognition (OCR) engine. b) all database components required to support the RPA solution c) all web browsers and versions it supports. d) All cloud base services it supports.",
   "M7 The software must not require the use of Adobe Flash or Shockwave for any functionality.",
   "M8 The solution must support Enterprise browser standards without degradation in functionality.",
   "M9 The solution must support the packaging and re-deployment of all required components within a given automation process in order to migrate a process from one RPA infrastructure environment to another such as from a Development environment to Production environment.",
   "R1.1 The solution should provide written a RPA strategic enterprise implementation plan which will be evaluated based on the following marking scheme: 1.1 E- SDC infrastructure requirements;",
   "R1.2 The solution should provide written a RPA strategic enterprise implementation plan which will be evaluated based on the following marking scheme: 1.2 - best practices for business and IT RPA Centres of Expertise (CoE);"
 ]
}
