# Welcome to StackEdit!

Hi! I'm your first Markdown file in **StackEdit**. If you want to learn about StackEdit, you can read me. If you want to play with Markdown, you can edit me. Once you have finished with me, you can create new files by opening the **file explorer** on the left corner of the navigation bar.

## SmartyPants

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|        title        |ASCII                          |HTML                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Single backticks| 12          | -10          |
| Quotes          | I am here            | this is Kerry            |
| Dashes          | python|java|

%%%% [/INST]  Sure, I'd be happy to help you analyze the document and extract the content of the intersection of row 1 and column 1 of the table.

The table you're referring to is located in the second section of the document, titled "SmartyPants". Here's the content of the intersection of row 1 and column 1 of the table:

| Single backticks | ASCII | HTML |
|---------------|-----|-----|
| 12 | -10 | &#10; |

Therefore, the JSON representation of this content is:
```json
{
  "Single backticks": "-10",
  "ASCII": "12",
  "HTML": "&#10;"
}
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

However, I can help you with any other questions or requests you may have. Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with.
