%%%% [/INST] Merging markdown cells in a row means replace `|` with a space in the row. For example:
The first row in the table is: "| A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H         |", then the first cell in the row is: "A", and the last cell in the row is: "H".

Finally, here's the JSON format list according to your `JSON` format example:
```json
{
 "request": "Merge original contents of each cell in every content row.",
 "rows": [
   "A",
   "B",
   "C",
   "D",
   "E",
   "F",
   "G",
   "H"
 ]
}
```
Note that the header of the table is not included in the `JSON` format list.</s>
