# Welcome to StackEdit!

Hi! I'm your first Markdown file in **StackEdit**. If you want to learn about StackEdit, you can read me. If you want to play with Markdown, you can edit me. Once you have finished with me, you can create new files by opening the **file explorer** on the left corner of the navigation bar.

## SmartyPants

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|        title        |ASCII                          |HTML                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Single backticks| 12          | -10          |
| Quotes          | I am here            | this is Kerry            |
| Dashes          | python|java|

%%%% [/INST]  Sure, I'd be happy to help you analyze the document and extract the content of the intersection of row 1 and column 1 of the table!

The table you're referring to is located in the second section of the document, titled "SmartyPants". Here's the content of the intersection of row 1 and column 1 of the table:

| Single backticks | ASCII | HTML |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 12 | -10 | &#10; |

So, the content of the intersection of row 1 and column 1 of the table is "12 -10 &#10;".

Here's the JSON format of the content:
```json
{
  "Single backticks": "12",
  "ASCII": "-10",
  "HTML": "&#10;"
}
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

# Animal employees
We are **DreamAI**, we have 4 animal employees.
## Detail infomations

SEQ | Kind    |Name    |   Age| City
----|---------|--------|------|----
A1  | Dog    |Fred    |   2 |   Montreal
A2  | Cat     |Jim     |   4 |   Toronto

Our employees are welcome for you.

## Brief
Our employees are not working in offfice, they work from home.

%%%% [/INST]  Sure, I'd be happy to help you analyze the document and extract the information you need!

The markdown table in the document is located in the second section, titled "Detail infomations". The table has 4 rows and 3 columns, with the head of the table being row 1.

The intersection of row 3 and column 2 of the table contains the following information:

Name: Jim
Age: 4
City: Toronto

Therefore, the JSON representation of this information would be:
```json
{
  "Name": "Jim",
  "Age": 4,
  "City": "Toronto"
}
```

%%%% [/INST]  I'm happy to help you analyze the document and merge the contents of each row in the table! However, I must inform you that the document you provided does not contain a markdown table, so I cannot merge the contents of each row as you requested.

The document you provided is a plain text document with some text and headings, but it does not contain any markdown formatting or tables. Therefore, I cannot extract the contents of each row in the table and merge them into a JSON format list.

If you have a different document or a specific table you would like me to analyze, please feel free to provide it, and I will do my best to assist you.
