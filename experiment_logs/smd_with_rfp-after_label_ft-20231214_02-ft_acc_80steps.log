%%%% [/INST]  Hello! I'm here to help you merge the markdown cells in each content row. However, I cannot provide false information, so I will not merge any cell that is not a content row.

Then, the merged cells are:
The first content row is:
| ADR    | Average Daily Rate                               |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------|

So, the merged cell is:
| ADR    | Average Daily Rate                               |

The second content row is:
| AOR    | Average Occupancy Rate                           |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------|

So, the merged cell is:
| AOR    | Average Occupancy Rate                           |

And so on...

Finally, here's the JSON format answer according to your `JSON` format example:
```json
{
 "request": "Merge original contents of each cell in every content row.",
 "rows": [
   "ADR Average Daily Rate",
   "AOR Average Occupancy Rate",

The header of the table is: "| ADR    | Average Daily Rate                               |", which is not a content row.

So, the merged rows in `JSON` format are:

```json
{
 "request": "Merge original contents of each cell in every content row.",
 "rows": [
   "ADR Average Daily Rate",
   "AOR Average Occupancy Rate",
   "API Application Programming Interface",
   "AWS Amazon Web Services",
   "BI Business Intelligence",
   "CBRE CBRE Group, Inc. - Coldwell Banker Richard Ellis",
   "CBSA Canada Border Services Agency",
   "CRM Customer Relationship Management",
   "CSV Comma-Separated Values",
   "DC Destination Canada",
   "DCM DoubleClick Campaign Manager",
   "ETL Extract, Transform, Load",
   "ETL Extract, Load, Transform",
   "IATA International Air Transport Association",
   "MDM Master Data Management",
   "NA Not Applicable",
   "NRFP Negotiated Request for Proposal",
   "PO Purchase Order",
   "RACI Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed",
   "RevPar Revenue Per Available Room",
   "SPSS Statistical Package for the Social Sciences"
 ]
}
```

Note that in the JSON format, the rows are enclosed in a `rows` key, which is a JSON array. Each cell of a row is a JSON object, with a key of the cell's content. For example, the first row in the JSON format is: "ADR Average Daily Rate", which is the cell of the first content row.</s>

%%%% [/INST]  Of course! I'll be happy to help you merge the markdown table rows in `JSON` format.

First, let me clarify that you want me to merge each content row in the table, which means replace `|` with a space in the row. For example:
The first row in the table is:
| M1   | The RPA solution must provide a bilingual (Official  languages– English and French) interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                             |

Then, the merged row in `JSON` format would be:
```json
{
 "request": "Merge each content row in the table",
 "rows": [
   "M1 The RPA solution must provide a bilingual (Official languages– English and French) interface.",
   "M2.1 The Contractor must provide a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) solution that will operate on an enterprise-class infrastructure using physical and virtual machines (VMs).",
   "M2.2 The RPA solution must include a design suite that will allow ESDC to develop and deliver automated processes.",
   "M3 The Contractor must provide a complete list of all components and version numbers included in their solution and must include: a) an Enterprise Optical character recognition (OCR) engine. b) all database components required to support the RPA solution c) all web browsers and versions it supports. d) All cloud base services it supports.",
   "M7 The software must not require the use of Adobe Flash or Shockwave for any functionality.",
   "M8 The solution must support Enterprise browser standards without degradation in functionality.",
   "M9 The solution must support the packaging and re-deployment of all required components within a given automation process in order to migrate a process from one RPA infrastructure environment to another such as from a Development environment to Production environment."
 ]
}
```

%%%% [/INST]  Of course! I'd be happy to help you merge the rows in the markdown table in `JSON` format.

First, I'll remove the table header from the markdown cell, since you don't want me to include it in the JSON format answer:

| Item     | Requirement                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Then, I'll iterate through each cell in the table and convert it to `JSON` format:

### A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H
Data Integration and  Preparation Platform must provide data connectors for common structured and  unstructured data sources (files (Excel, CSV), databases, business  applications),  marketing  platforms  (advertising,  social,  content,  analytics), as well as the ability to develop custom API connectors.

### L
Data Lineage Platform must provide ability to track the full lifecycle of data, including and change alert capabilities.

### M
Data Glossary / Catalogue Platform should automatically crawl, profile, organize, link, enrich, and document all metadata with supporting data glossary

### A
Data Integration and  Preparation Platform must provide data connectors for common cloud data storage  platforms  including  Amazon  RedShift,  Google  BigQuery,  Snowflake,  Azure SQL, and relational databases such as Oracle, SQL Server, and  PostgreSQL and Microsoft Excel.

### D
Data Preparation Platform needs to provide basic data preparation management capabilities including job scheduler, versioning, task management, and  audit log capabilities.

### E
Data Visualization and  Analysis Platform should provide ability for non-technical analysts and business  users  to  create  interactive  reports  and  dashboards  composed  of  charts,  graphs,  maps  charts  with  layers,  and  other  visualizations  through an intuitive and easy to use web-based user interface.

### F
Platform should provide ability to refine visualizations by selecting different chart types and data series or applying filters and drilldowns.

### G
Platform should provide ability to set notification alerts when the data  changes beyond defined thresholds

Finally, here's the JSON format answer according to your `JSON` format example:

```json
{
 "request": "Merge rows in markdown table",
 "rows": [
   "Data Integration and Preparation Platform must provide data connectors for common structured and unstructured data sources (files (Excel, CSV), databases, business applications), marketing platforms (advertising, social, content, analytics), as well as the ability to develop custom API connectors.",
   "Data Lineage Platform must provide ability to track the full lifecycle of data, including and change alert capabilities.",
   "Data Glossary / Catalogue Platform should automatically crawl, profile, organize, link, enrich, and document all metadata with supporting data glossary",
   "Data Integration and Preparation Platform must provide data connectors for common cloud data storage platforms including Amazon RedShift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, Azure SQL, and relational databases such as Oracle, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL and Microsoft Excel.",
   "Data Preparation Platform needs to provide basic data preparation management capabilities including job scheduler, versioning, task management, and audit log capabilities.",
   "Data Visualization and Analysis Platform should provide ability for non-technical analysts and business users to create interactive reports and dashboards composed of charts, graphs, maps charts with layers, and other visualizations through an intuitive and easy to use web-based user interface.",
   "Platform should provide ability to refine visualizations by selecting different chart types and data series or applying filters and drilldowns.",
   "Platform should provide ability to set notification alerts when the data changes beyond defined thresholds"
 ]
}
