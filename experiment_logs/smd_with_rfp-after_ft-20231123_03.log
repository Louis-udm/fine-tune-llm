# Animal employees
We are **DreamAI**, we have 4 animal employees.
## Detail infomations

SEQ | Kind    |Name    |   Age| City
----|---------|--------|------|----
A1  | Dog    |Fred    |   2 |   Montreal
A2  | Cat     |Jim     |   4 |   Toronto
B1  | Snake   |Harry   |   3 |   Vancouver
B2  | Bird   |Louis   |   5 |   Ottawa

Our employees are welcome for you.

## Brief
Our employees are not working in offfice, they work from home.

%%%% [/INST] First, the markdown table is:
SEQ | Kind    |Name    |   Age| City
----|---------|--------|------|----
A1  | Dog    |Fred    |   2 |   Montreal

B1  | Snake   |Harry   |   3 |   Vancouver
B2  | Bird   |Louis   |   5 |   Ottawa

The header row, which is not the first content row, includes column names such as SEQ, Kind, Name, Age, and City.

Second, row 3 is:
B1  | Snake   |Harry   |   3 |   Vancouver

Third, column 2 in row 3 is:
Snake

Finally, here's the JSON format answer according to your `JSON` format example:

Hi! I'm your first Markdown file in **StackEdit**. If you want to learn about StackEdit, you can read me. If you want to play with Markdown, you can edit me. Once you have finished with me, you can create new files by opening the **file explorer** on the left corner of the navigation bar.

## SmartyPants

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|        title        |ASCII                          |HTML                         |

| Quotes          | I am here            | this is Kerry            |
| Dashes          | python|java|

%%%% [/INST] First, the markdown table is:

| Quotes          | I am here            | this is Kerry            |
| Dashes          | python|java|

The header row, which is not the first content row, includes column names such as title, ASCII and HTML.

Second, merge original contents of each cell in every row:
Single backticks| 12          | -10          |
Quotes          | I am here            | this is Kerry            |
Dashes          | python|java|

Finally, here's the `JSON` format answer according to your `JSON` format example:
```json
{
  "request": "Merge original contents of each cell in every row.",
  "rows": [
    "Single backticks| 12          | -10          |",

    "Dashes          | python|java|"

Note that the `JSON` format answer includes an array of strings, each string is a merged content of a cell in a row, and the keys of the `JSON` object are the same as the column names in the table.
