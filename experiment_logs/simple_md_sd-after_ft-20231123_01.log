# Animal employees
We are **DreamAI**, we have 4 animal employees.
## Detail infomations

SEQ | Kind    |Name    |   Age| City
----|---------|--------|------|----
A1  | Dog    |Fred    |   2 |   Montreal
A2  | Cat     |Jim     |   4 |   Toronto
B1  | Snake   |Harry   |   3 |   Vancouver
B2  | Bird   |Louis   |   5 |   Ottawa

Our employees are welcome for you.

## Brief
Our employees are not working in offfice, they work from home.

%%%% [/INST] First, the markdown table is:
SEQ | Kind    |Name    |   Age| City
----|---------|--------|------|----
A1  | Dog    |Fred    |   2 |   Montreal
A2  | Cat     |Jim     |   4 |   Toronto
B1  | Snake   |Harry   |   3 |   Vancouver
B2  | Bird   |Louis   |   5 |   Ottawa

The first content row is not the head of table, so the head of table is:
SEQ | Kind    |Name    |   Age| City

Now, the content found in the intersection of row 3 and column 2 of the table is:
B1  | Snake   |Harry   |   3 |   Vancouver

And the JSON format answer is:
```json
{
  "content": {
    "B1": "Snake",
    "Harry": "3",
    "Vancouver": "Vancouver"
  }
}
```

Analyze the document below. Within the document, locate the markdown table, then merge (combine) the original contents in all cells for each row, and return in `JSON` format list. Note that the head of table is not the first content row. The definition of the `JSON` result is like:
```json
{{
  "rows": [
    "first row merged contents",
    "second row merged contents"

## SmartyPants

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|        title        |ASCII                          |HTML                         |

| Single backticks| 12          | -10          |
| Quotes          | I am here            | this is Kerry            |
| Dashes          | python|java|
