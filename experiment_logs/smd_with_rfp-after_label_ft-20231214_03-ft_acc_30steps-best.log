%%%% [/INST]  Great, I'm happy to help you with that!

To merge the original contents of each cell in each content row, I will use the following format:
```json
{
 "header": "Original Cell",
 "rows": [
   "M1   | The RPA solution must provide a bilingual (Official languages– English and French) interface.",
   "M2.1 | The Contractor must provide a Robotic Process Automation  (RPA) solution that will operate on an enterprise-class  infrastructure using physical and virtual machines (VMs).",
   "M2.2 | The RPA solution must include a design suite that will allow  ESDC to develop and deliver automated processes.",
   "M3   | The Contractor must provide a complete list of all  components and version numbers included in their solution  and must include:   a)  an Enterprise Optical character recognition (OCR)  engine.   b)  all database components required to support the  RPA solution  c)  all web browsers and versions it supports.   d)  All cloud base services it supports.",
   "M7   | The software must not require the use of Adobe Flash or Shockwave for any functionality.",
   "M8   | The solution must support Enterprise browser standards  without degradation in functionality.",
   "M9   | The solution must support the packaging and re- deployment of all required components within a given  automation process in order to migrate a process from one  RPA infrastructure environment to another such as from a  Development environment to Production environment.",
   "R1.1 | The solution should provide written a  RPA strategic enterprise    implementation plan which will be  evaluated based on the following  marking scheme:   1.1 E- SDC infrastructure requirements;",
   "R1.2 | The solution should provide written a  RPA strategic enterprise    implementation plan which will be  evaluated based on the following  marking scheme:   1.2 - best practices for business and IT  RPA Centres of Expertise (CoE);"

}
```
