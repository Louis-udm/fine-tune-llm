%%%% [/INST] The header of the table is "| ADR    | Average Daily Rate                               |", which is the content row 1

Then, the merged original contents in each cell of the content row 1 are: "Average Daily Rate", "Average Occupancy Rate", "Application Programming Interface", "Amazon Web Services", "Business Intelligence", "Customer Relationship Management", "Comma-Separated Values", "Destination Canada", "DoubleClick Campaign Manager", "Extract, Transform, Load", "Extract, Load, Transform", "International Air Transport Association", "Master Data Management", "Not Applicable", "Negotiated Request for Proposal", "Purchase Order", "Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed", "Revenue Per Available Room", "Statistical Package for the Social Sciences"

Finally, here's the JSON format answer according to your `JSON` format example:
```json
{
  "request": "Merge original contents of each cell in every content row.",
  "rows": [
    "Average Daily Rate",
    "Average Occupancy Rate",
    "Application Programming Interface",
    "Amazon Web Services",

    "Customer Relationship Management",
    "Comma-Separated Values",
    "Destination Canada",
    "DoubleClick Campaign Manager",
    "Extract, Transform, Load",
    "Extract, Load, Transform",

    "Purchase Order",
    "Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed",
    "Revenue Per Available Room",
    "Statistical Package for the Social Sciences"

}
```
Note that the header of the `JSON` format answer is "request", which is the same as the definition in the `JSON` format example.
