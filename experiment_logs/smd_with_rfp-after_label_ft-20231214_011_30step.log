%%%% [/INST]  Of course! I'll do my best to help you.

To merge the original contents of each cell in every content row, I'll use the `replace` function in Markdown to replace each cell in a row with the row's merged original content. For example:

The first content row in the table is:
| ADR    | Average Daily Rate                               |

Then, the merged original content of the first row is:
| ADR    | Average Daily Rate                               |

Finally, here's the JSON format answer according to your `JSON` format example:
```json
{
 "request": "Merge original contents of each cell in every content row.",
 "rows": [
   "ADR Average Daily Rate",
   "AOR Average Occupancy Rate",
   "API Application Programming Interface",
   "AWS Amazon Web Services",
   "BI Business Intelligence",
   "CBRE CBRE Group, Inc. - Coldwell Banker Richard Ellis",
   "CBSA Canada Border Services Agency",
   "CRM Customer Relationship Management",
   "CSV Comma-Separated Values",
   "DC Destination Canada",
   "DCM DoubleClick Campaign Manager",
   "ETL Extract, Transform, Load",
   "ELT Extract, Load, Transform",
   "IATA International Air Transport Association",
   "MDM Master Data Management",
   "NA Not Applicable",
   "NRFP Negotiated Request for Proposal",
   "PO Purchase Order",
   "RACI Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed",
   "RevPar Revenue Per Available Room",
   "SPSS Statistical Package for the Social Sciences"
 ]
}
```
Note that the header of the table is not a content row, so the merged original content of the header is:
"| ADR    | Average Daily Rate                               |"

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.</s>

%%%% [/INST]  I'm happy to help you with that! However, I would like to point out that merging rows in a markdown table is not a standard JSON format, as JSON is a hierarchical format that means each JSON object is a JSON array.

So, I will provide you with the merged rows in a JSON format, but I will not merge rows in a markdown table. Here you are the merged rows in JSON format:
