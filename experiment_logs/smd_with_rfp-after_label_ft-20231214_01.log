DC anticipates entering into negotiations with the selected proponent(s) for up to a five (5) year period,
with an option to extend on an annual basis by DC for a total period not to exceed another five (5) years,
at DC’s sole discretion. DC does not grant exclusivity, guarantee business or make any guarantee of the

To merge the original contents of each cell in every content row, I'll use the `replace` function in Google Sheets. Here's how:

1. Select the entire table, then right-click and choose "Replace" from the context menu.
2. In the "Find and replace" dialog box, enter the following formula: `=CONCATENATE(A1,B1,C1,...)`
3. Replace "A1,B1,C1,..." with the cell of the first content row.
4. Click "Replace all" to apply the formula to all cells in the table.

Finally, here's the JSON format answer according to your `JSON` format example:
```json

%%%% [/INST]  Of course! I'll do my best to help you.

To merge the rows of the markdown table in `JSON` format, you can use a `JSON` format example like this:
```json
{
 "request": "Merge original contents of each cell in every content row.",
 "rows": [
   "Item A B C D E F G H Data Integration and Preparation Platform must provide data connectors for common structured and unstructured data sources (files (Excel, CSV), databases, business applications), marketing platforms (advertising, social, content, analytics), as well as the ability to develop custom API connectors.",
   "L Data Lineage Platform must provide ability to track the full lifecycle of data, including change alert capabilities.",
   "M Data Glossary / Catalogue Platform should automatically crawl, profile, organize, link, enrich, and document all metadata with supporting data glossary",
   "A Data Integration and Preparation Platform must provide data connectors for common cloud data storage platforms including Amazon RedShift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, Azure SQL, and relational databases such as Oracle, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL and Microsoft Excel.",
   "D Data Preparation Platform needs to provide basic data preparation management capabilities including job scheduler, versioning, task management, and audit log capabilities.",
   "E Data Visualization and Analysis Platform should provide ability for non-technical analysts and business users to create interactive reports and dashboards composed of charts, graphs, maps charts with layers, and other visualizations through an intuitive and easy to use web-based user interface.",
   "F Data Visualization and Analysis Platform should provide ability to refine visualizations by selecting different chart types and data series or applying filters and drilldowns.",
   "G Data Notifications Platform should provide ability to set notification alerts when the data changes beyond defined thresholds"
 ]
}
```
Note that in `JSON` format, the request is a string in the `JSON` format, and the rows are an array of strings.

Finally, here's the merged markdown table in `JSON` format according to your `JSON` format example:
```json
{
 "request": "Merge original contents of each cell in every content row.",
 "rows": [
   "Item A B C D E F G H Data Integration and Preparation",
   "L Data Lineage",
   "M Data Glossary / Catalogue",
   "A Data Integration and Preparation",
   "D Data Preparation",
   "E Data Visualization and Analysis",
   "F Data Visualization and Analysis",
   "G Data Notifications"
 ]
}
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.</s>
