## SmartyPants

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|        title        |ASCII                          |HTML                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Single backticks| 12          | -10          |
| Quotes          | I am here            | this is Kerry            |
| Dashes          | python|java|
