Analyze the document contained by %%%% below. Within the document, locate the markdown table, then merge (combine) the original contents in all cells for each row, and return in `JSON` format list. Note that the header of table is not the first content row. The definition of the `JSON` result is like:
```json
{{
  "request": "Merge original contents of each cell in every row.",
  "rows": [
    "first row merged contents",
    "second row merged contents"

## SmartyPants

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|        title        |ASCII                          |HTML                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Single backticks| 12          | -10          |
| Quotes          | I am here            | this is Kerry            |
| Dashes          | python|java|

^^^^^^^^

First, the markdown table is:
|        title        |ASCII                          |HTML                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Single backticks| 12          | -10          |
| Quotes          | I am here            | this is Kerry            |
| Dashes          | python|java|

The header row, which is not the first content row, includes column names such as title, ASCII and HTML.

Second, merge original contents of each cell in every row:
The merged first row content is: Single backticks 12 -10
The merged second row content is: Quotes I am here this is Kerry
The merged third row content is: Dashes python java

Finally, here's the JSON format answer according to your `JSON` format example:
```json
{
  "request": "Merge original contents of each cell in every row.",
  "rows": [
    "Single backticks 12 -10",
    "Quotes I am here this is Kerry",
    "Dashes python java"
  ]
}
```
