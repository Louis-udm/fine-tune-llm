## SmartyPants

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|        title        |ASCII                          |HTML                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Single backticks| 12          | -10          |
| Quotes          | I am here            | this is Kerry            |
| Dashes          | python|java|

%%%%


^^^^A^^^^

The header of the table is "|        title        |ASCII                          |HTML                         |", which is not content row

So, row 2 is:
| Quotes          | I am here            | this is Kerry            |

Finally, here's the JSON format answer according to your `JSON` format example:
```json
{
  "row_num": 2,
  "content": "| Quotes          | I am here            | this is Kerry            |"
}
```
