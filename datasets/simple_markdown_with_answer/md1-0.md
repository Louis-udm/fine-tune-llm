## SmartyPants

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|        title        |ASCII                          |HTML                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Single backticks| 12          | -10          |
| Quotes          | I am here            | this is Kerry            |
| Dashes          | python|java|

^^^^^^^^

First, the markdown table is:
|        title        |ASCII                          |HTML                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Single backticks| 12          | -10          |
| Quotes          | I am here            | this is Kerry            |
| Dashes          | python|java|

The header row, which is not the first content row, includes column names such as title, ASCII and HTML.

Second, row 1 is:
| Single backticks| 12          | -10          |
Then, column 1 in row 1 is: 
Single backticks

Finally, here's the JSON format answer according to your `JSON` format example:
```json
{
  "request": "Intersection content of row 1 and column 1 in the table",
  "content": "Single backticks"
}
```
